A python script that analyzes and changes the Wolf Glycolysis model, for demonstration purposes.

Excercise:

<ol>
  <li>Visit https://github.com/luciansmith/network-modeling-example
  <li>Copy the python script into colab and run it.<br>
  (Note: you'll probably need a '!pip install tellurium' added at the top.)
  <li>It doesn't oscillate!  Did it use to?  Check out the very first version and check.
  <li>Find out when I made a mistake and why it happened.
  <li>File a bug report ('issue') and describe what the problem is.
ADVANCED
  <li>Create a fork of the repository
  <li>Fix the model so it oscillates again, check that in to your fork.
  <li>Put back in the annotations and units, check that in.
  <li>(extra advanced): Create a pull request back to my repository to fix everything.
</ol>
